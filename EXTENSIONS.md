Do refer to all - ###GOOD TO HAVE BUT NOT MANDATORY ....### comments added in main.py & database.py scripts
The extra chunk of code added under "###GOOD TO HAVE BUT NOT MANDATORY ....###" comments is at present disabled. But if enabled they will do the following :
1) Print all NEOs/NEO objects having the same name (instead of printing any one NEO)
2) Print all corresponding close approaches of all those NEOs that have the same name (instead of printing for only a single NEO)
